    Scenario: capturing employment details so that RPS can verify these details
        Given the app is running
         When we visit /claim-redundancy-payment/employment-details/
         Then the page should have title "Employment Details"
          And the page should have an input field called "job_title" labeled "Job Title"
          And the page should have an input field called "category_of_worker" labeled "Category of Worker"
          And the page should have an input field called "start_date" labeled "When did you start working for this employer?"
          And the page should have an input field called "end_date" labeled "When did your employment end?"
